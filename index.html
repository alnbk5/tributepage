                As a kid, he was inspired to get into medicine when his grandma reversed her advanced heart disease by switching to a plant-based diet. She went from being in a wheelchair on deathâ€™s door to walking 10 miles a day within three weeks of the switch.

                "If [you are] over the age of 10, the question isn't whether or not to eat healthy to prevent heart disease, it's whether or not you want to reverse the heart disease you already have."
